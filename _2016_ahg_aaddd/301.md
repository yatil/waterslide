* Contrast at least 4.5:1 <span class="deem small">(WCAG also allows 3:1 for bold or large text)</span>
* Clickable areas should
    - look clickable
    - have a large enough size to accommodate touch input (min 44–48px each side)
* Be consistent across pages
* Use large fonts – 1rem (16px) is good, 1.125rem (18px) is even better
* Keep line-heights at about 1.5
