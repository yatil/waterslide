<p>The following is an excerpt from the
   <cite>The Story of my Life</cite>
   by Helen Keller</p>
<blockquote cite="https://â€¦">
    <p>Even in the days before my teacher came,
    I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood
    hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell,
    would find the first violets and lilies.
    There, too, after a fit of temper,
    I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face
    in the cool leaves and grass.</p>
